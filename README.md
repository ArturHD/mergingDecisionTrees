## Note: this code needs some work
As of February 2021, this code might need some refactoring and changes to work with current version of Groovy and the libraries. It is also necessary to set up the (included) experiment execution software "batchrunner" to reproduce the experiments. If someone manages to bring this code up-to-date and run it, please submit a pull request, I will update it.
